# ScRNAseq-of-AGA
Codes for analysis of scRNA-seq data from AGA patients.
To learn the protocol of how we conduct the single cell RNA sequencing, please see Protocol-of-scRNA-seq.
After we access our scRNA-seq data, we did the primary bioinformatic treatment, following the code in Main_scRNA_seq.
All visualization and analysis codes could be found in the corresponding file.

Moreover, information of patients whose hair follicle samples were used for scRNA-seq is in the excel file.
